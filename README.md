# educative-JS-challenge
The objective is to make a social news web page.
- A link is defined by its title, its URL and its author (submitter).
- If a new link URL does not start with `"http://"` or `"https://"`, `"http://"` is automatically added at its beginning.
- The web page displays a list of at least three already existing links.
- A button exists for the user to submit a new link. When clicked, a form appears before the link list to input the new link properties (author, title and URL).
- In this form, all link fields are mandatory.
- When the new link is validated by the user, it is displayed at the top of the link list, replacing the form.
- HTML and CSS has already been provided.

Here are a few screenshots of the expected result.
